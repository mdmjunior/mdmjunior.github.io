## Prerequisites for Installing Docker on Ubuntu 24.04
Before you dive into deploying Docker containers, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Ubuntu 24.04 installed**: This guide assumes you are using the latest version of Ubuntu. Ensure your system is updated:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```plaintext
   [...] Packages are listed by name to be upgraded
   0 installed, 0 upgraded, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
   ```
2. **Root or sudo access**: You will need administrative privileges to install Docker.
3. **A basic understanding of terminal commands**: You should be comfortable using the command line interface.

## Installing Docker Engine
To deploy Docker containers, first, you'll need to install Docker Engine. Here are the steps:

1. **Install required packages**: This will allow apt to use packages over HTTPS:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
   ```
2. **Add Docker's official GPG key**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```
3. **Set up the stable repository**:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```
4. **Install Docker Engine**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker-ce -y
   ```
5. **Verify that Docker is running**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl status docker
   ```
   Expected output should show that the Docker service is active and running.

## Running Your First Docker Container
Now that Docker is installed, let's deploy your first container. We'll use the hello-world image as a quick test:

1. **Pull the hello-world image**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker pull hello-world
   ```
2. **Run the hello-world container**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```plaintext
   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
   ```

## Managing Docker Containers
Once your first container is up and running, understanding how to manage your Docker containers is crucial:

1. **List running containers**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps
   ```
   This command displays the currently running containers with their status.

2. **List all containers (including stopped)**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps -a
   ```

3. **Stopping a running container**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker stop <container_id>
   ```
   Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID or name.

4. **Removing a container**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker rm <container_id>
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
During your Docker journey, you may encounter various issues. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Docker daemon not starting**: If the Docker daemon does not start, check logs for errors using:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u docker.service
   ```
2. **Permission denied errors**: If you get permission denied errors when running Docker commands, consider adding your user to the Docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
   Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

3. **Container not running**: If your container exits immediately, check its logs for errors:
   ```bash
   sudo docker logs <container_id>
   ```

## Conclusion
Deploying Docker containers on Ubuntu 24.04 is straightforward if you follow these structured steps. By mastering Docker, you set the groundwork for efficient, scalable application deployment patterns. Whether you're a seasoned DevOps professional or a beginner, Docker provides powerful tools to enhance your workflows.
