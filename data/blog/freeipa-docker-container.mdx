Deploying identity management solutions in containers is increasingly popular in modern infrastructures. But how do you effectively set up FreeIPA on Docker? FreeIPA provides centralized authentication, authorization, and account information, which is crucial for many Linux-based environments. In this post, I'll guide you through the steps to deploy FreeIPA in a Docker container on a CentOS system—perfect for those who value efficient, scalable, and manageable identity solutions.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A CentOS machine with Docker installed.
- Basic understanding of Linux command-line.
- Sudo privileges.

To install Docker on CentOS, use these commands:

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Step 1: Pulling the FreeIPA Docker Image
Next, you need to pull the FreeIPA Docker image from the official repository. Run:

```bash
sudo docker pull freeipa/freeipa-server
```

Check the download progress through this command:

```bash
docker images
```

Expected output:

```
REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
freeipa/freeipa-server    latest              abcdef123456        2 weeks ago        524MB
```

### Step 2: Running the FreeIPA Container
To run the FreeIPA server, use the following command, replacing `<your_domain>` with your actual domain (like `example.com`):

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name freeipa-server \ 
  -e PASSWORD='YourStrongPassword' \ 
  -h freeipa.<your_domain> \ 
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 389:389 -p 636:636 \ 
  freeipa/freeipa-server
```

You may expose additional ports as necessary depending on your use case. To verify the container is running, execute:

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected output:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                             NAMES
12345abcd           freeipa/freeipa-server    "run --server --..."   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, ...   freeipa-server
```

### Step 3: Configuring FreeIPA
To configure FreeIPA, you can access the web interface via your browser by navigating to `https://<your_server_ip>`. Follow the setup wizard to complete configuration. You will need to enter your domain, a Kerberos realm, and admin credentials. Here’s a command to check logs during setup:

```bash
sudo docker logs freeipa-server
```

### Step 4: Verifying the Installation
After the configuration is completed, verify that FreeIPA is running correctly:

Use the FreeIPA client to check server status:

```bash
sudo ipa-healthcheck
```

Expected output:

```
FreeIPA server is healthy.
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **If the container does not start**, ensure that all necessary ports are free and not being used by other services.
- **For LDAP-related errors**, ensure firewall rules allow LDAP traffic.
- Use `docker exec` to access the running container and check logs for debugging:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it freeipa-server /bin/bash
```

### Conclusion
Deploying FreeIPA in a Docker container simplifies the management of user identities and access control across multiple systems. This setup allows you to leverage containerization benefits, such as easy scalability and management. With these straightforward steps and practical commands, you can have your FreeIPA server running securely and efficiently on Docker. Keep experimenting with the configurations to tailor it to your organizational needs!
