As your Docker workloads grow, storage management becomes a crucial factor in maintaining system performance and reliability. By default, Docker stores
its data on the system disk, which can lead to space limitations, performance bottlenecks, and potential system crashes. In this guide, we'll walk you
through the process of moving Docker's storage to an external or dedicated disk. This simple adjustment can help improve performance, increase storage
capacity, and enhance scalability. Whether you're managing a production environment or optimizing your development setup, this step-by-step tutorial
will ensure a smooth transition.

## Why Move Docker Data to an External Disk?
<div align="justify">
By default, Docker stores its data in /var/lib/docker, which is usually located on the system's main disk. As containerized applications grow, Docker's
storage requirements can increase significantly, leading to potential performance issues, limited space, and even system crashes if the main disk becomes
full. Moving Docker's storage to an external or dedicated disk offers several benefits:

- **Improved Performance:** Separating Docker's data from the main system disk can reduce I/O bottlenecks, especially in high-traffic environments.
- **Increased Storage Capacity:** A dedicated disk allows for more space, preventing Docker from consuming the root partition.
- **Better Reliability and Scalability:** Using an external or dedicated disk makes it easier to scale storage without affecting the system's core operations.
- **Easier Backup and Recovery:** Storing Docker data separately simplifies backup and disaster recovery processes.

For these reasons, moving Docker's storage to an external disk is a recommended best practice for maintaining a stable and efficient containerized environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using an Extra Disk for Docker
<div align="justify">
For this tutorial, I'll assume you have an extra disk mounted on your system and want to move Docker's data to this new location. Follow these steps to
safely transfer Docker's storage to an external disk:
</div>
### 1 - Stop Docker:

First, stop the Docker service to prevent any write operations while moving the data.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
```

### 2 - Move the Data to the New Location:

Copy the current Docker directory (/var/lib/docker) to the new location at /mnt/docker-swarm.

```bash
sudo rsync -aH /var/lib/docker/ /mnt/docker-swarm/docker
```

### 3 - Rename the Old Directory (Optional)

For safety, you can rename the original directory before creating a symbolic link.

```bash
sudo mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.bak
```

### 5 - Verify Permissions:

Ensure the permissions are correct for Docker to access the new location.

```bash
sudo chown -R root:root /mnt/docker-swarm/docker
sudo chmod -R 755 /mnt/docker-swarm/docker
```

### 6 - Restart Docker:

Now, restart the Docker service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl start docker.socket
```
---

### 7 - Verify Everything is Working:

Check if Docker is using the new directory correctly.

```bash
docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir"
```
---

### Cleanup (Optional)

After verifying that everything is working correctly, you can remove the old backup:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker.bak
```
---

## Troubleshooting

If any overlay is mounted, as shown in the example below, it will be necessary to unmount it:

```bash
root@server:~# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev             16G     0   16G   0% /dev
tmpfs           3.2G  688K  3.2G   1% /run
/dev/sdb1        19G   11G  9.0G  54% /
tmpfs            16G     0   16G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
/dev/sda1       100G  6.3G   94G   7% /mnt/docker-swarm
tmpfs           3.2G     0  3.2G   0% /run/user/1000
overlay          19G   11G  9.0G  54% /var/lib/docker.bak/overlay2     19G   11G  9.0G  54% /var/lib/docker.bak/overlay2
```

### Steps to Fix the Issue

**1 - Stop the Docker Service (Again):**

Before unmounting the file systems, stop Docker to ensure it does not keep active mounts.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
```

**2 - Unmount the Overlay File Systems:**

Use the umount command to manually unmount each overlay file system. For example:

```bash
sudo umount /var/lib/docker.bak/overlay2/31fd0871764cc9bcc280854fbef90b83dfcc7d739c94edf37419c65e2b9d11b6/merged
sudo umount /var/lib/docker.bak/overlay2/a1a1281a34cd33b01f940d94012f66caab599640e24ac3d86d36f7b1bd8a26c4/merged
sudo umount /var/lib/docker.bak/overlay2/67cbc6754500503cbc507f645f59a66e288a580377d281d45f38df81a7146e68/merged
```

**3 - Check if All File Systems Have Been Unmounted:**

Use the df -h or mount command to check if there are no more overlay mounts in the /var/lib/docker.bak directory.

**4 - Confirm the Data Move:**

Now that the file systems have been unmounted, you can proceed to move the data to the new location without risk of errors.

**5 - Delete the Original Backup (Optional):**

If you are confident that the new setup is working, you can remove the backup folder:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker.bak
```

**6 - Restart Docker:**

Start Docker again to check if it is working correctly with the new directory:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl start docker.socket
```
