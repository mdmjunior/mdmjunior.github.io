# **LXC Commands Cheat Sheet: A Comprehensive Guide**

<p align="justify">
Continuing the last post about LXD containers, here goes my compiled Cheat Sheet to manage LXD as a master.
</p>

## **Creating and Launching Containers**

<p align="justify">
The `lxc launch` command creates and starts a new container from an existing image. It combines the creation (`lxc init`) and start (`lxc start`) processes into 
one command, making it a convenient way to get a container running quickly.
</p>
**Syntax:**

```bash
lxc launch <image> <container-name>
```

- `<image>`: The image to use for the container. You can list available images using `lxc image list`.
- `<container-name>`: A unique name for the new container.

This command creates and starts a container named `mycontainer` using the Ubuntu 24.04 image.

## **List Containers**

Displays a list of all containers, including their current state, IP addresses, and other relevant information. It's useful for getting an overview 
of the containers running on your host.

**Syntax:**

```bash
lxc list
```

This command provides a table of all containers, showing their name, status, IP addresses, and other details.

## **Stop Containers**

Stops a running container. This is useful when you need to shut down a container for maintenance or resource management.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc stop <container-name>
```
- `<container-name>`: The name of the container you want to stop.

This command stops the container named `mycontainer`.

## **Start Containers**

Starts a stopped container. This is the counterpart to `lxc stop`, allowing you to resume operations on a previously halted container.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc start <container-name>
```

This starts the container named `mycontainer`.

## **Container Execution**

Executes a command inside a running container. It is similar to SSH but is more efficient since it does not require an SSH server within the container.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc exec <container-name> -- <command>
```

- `<container-name>`: The name of the container.
- `<command>`: The command you want to run inside the container.

This opens an interactive bash shell inside `mycontainer`.

## **Delete Containers**

Deletes a stopped container permanently. Be cautious as this action is irreversible.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc delete <container-name>
```

This deletes the container named `mycontainer`.

## **Get Container Information**

Displays detailed information about a specific container, including its status, resource usage, network configuration, and more.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc info <container-name>
```

This shows comprehensive details about `mycontainer`.

## **Container Backup and Snapshot**

Creates a snapshot of the container's current state, enabling you to roll back to this state later if needed.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc snapshot <container-name> <snapshot-name>
```

- `<container-name>`: The name of the container.
- `<snapshot-name>`: A unique name for the snapshot.

This creates a snapshot named `initial-setup` for `mycontainer`.

## **Restoring**

Restores a container to a previously created snapshot. This is useful for reverting changes or recovering from errors.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc restore <container-name> <snapshot-name>
```

This restores `mycontainer` to the state saved in the `initial-setup` snapshot.

## **Configuration**

Manages container configurations, including resource limits and device mappings. It allows you to modify the settings of a container dynamically.

**Syntax:**
```bash
lxc config set <container-name> <key> <value>
```

- `<container-name>`: The name of the container.
- `<key>`: The configuration option to change.
- `<value>`: The new value for the configuration option.

This sets the CPU limit of `mycontainer` to 2 cores.

## Conclusion

These LXC commands are fundamental for efficiently managing containers on Ubuntu 24.04. Mastering them enhances your system administration and 
DevOps skills, making it easier to deploy and maintain isolated environments for development and production.
