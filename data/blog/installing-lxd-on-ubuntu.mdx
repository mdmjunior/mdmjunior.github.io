# How to Install LXD using Snap on Ubuntu 24.04

![DeployLXC](/static/images/deploylxc.jpeg)

If you're looking to set up LXD on Ubuntu 24.04, you've come to the right place. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of 
installing LXD using Snap, assuming you already have Ubuntu installed, a wired network connection, and ZFS set up. Let's get started!

## Why Use Snap to Install LXD?

Snap packages are secure, easy to update, and maintain. Canonical, the creator of Ubuntu, recommends using Snap for LXD because it 
ensures you always get the latest features and security patches.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Ubuntu 24.04 installed
- Wired network connection (recommended for server setups)
- ZFS installed and configured as your storage backend

## Step 1: Update your system

Start by updating your package list and upgrading existing packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
This ensures that all packages are up to date before installing LXD.

## Step 2: Install Snapd

Snapd should come pre-installed on Ubuntu 24.04. However, if it's not installed, run:

```bash
sudo apt install snapd -y
```
After installing, make sure Snapd is up and running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status snapd
```
If Snapd is not running, start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start snapd
```

## Step 3: Install LXD Using Snap

To install the latest version of LXD, use the following command:

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
```
This will download and install the latest stable version of LXD from the Snap store.

## Step 4: Add your user to the LXD group

To manage LXD containers without using sudo, add your user to the lxd group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG lxd $USER
```
Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect. Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
newgrp lxd
```
This command will add your user to the lxd group without logging out.

## Step 5: Initialize LXD

After adding your user to the LXD group, initialize LXD with the following command:

```bash
lxd init
```
This command will guide you through the LXD initialization process, allowing you to set up your storage backend, network configuration, and other settings.

During the interactive setup, you'll be prompted with several questions. Here are the recommended settings for using ZFS:



## Conclusion

LXD stands out as a hybrid technology between containers and VMs, offering the best of both worlds: performance, flexibility, and isolation.
While Docker dominates application containers, LXD is the ultimate choice for system containers.

If you haven't tried LXD yet, it's time to explore its power! In the next posts, we'll cover installation, configuration, and advanced usage.
Stay tuned!
