### Getting Started with LXC
LXC simplifies the process of running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single host. To start using LXC, ensure that it's installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lxc
```

After installation, verify LXC's version:

```bash
lxc --version
```
Expected output:
```plaintext
4.0.6
```

### Creating a New Container
Creating a new container is straightforward. The primary command is `lxc-create`. Hereâ€™s how to create a container running Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo lxc-create -n my-container -t ubuntu
```

This command creates a new container named `my-container` using the Ubuntu template. Check the status of the newly created container with:

```bash
sudo lxc-ls -f
```
Expected output:
```plaintext
NAME           STATE    AUTOSTART  GROUP     IPV4              IPV6
my-container   RUNNING  0          -         10.0.3.25        -
```

### Starting and Stopping Containers
To start your new container, use:

```bash
sudo lxc-start -n my-container
```

You can access the shell of the container using:

```bash
sudo lxc-attach -n my-container
```

To stop a running container, simply use:

```bash
sudo lxc-stop -n my-container
```

### Managing Container Configuration
Each container has a configuration file located in `/var/lib/lxc/my-container/config`. You can modify settings such as networking parameters or resource limits. For example, to set a memory limit for your container, add the following line to the configuration file:

```plaintext
lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes = 512M
```

### Networking with LXC
By default, LXC uses a bridge for network connectivity. You can see the current network settings of your container with:

```bash
sudo lxc-info -n my-container
```

To configure your container's network settings, consider editing the configuration file mentioned earlier. For example, to assign a static IP, you might add:

```plaintext
lxc.network.type = veth
lxc.network.flags = up
lxc.network.link = lxcbr0
lxc.network.name = eth0
lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.25/24
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues starting or managing containers, consider checking:
1. **Container Logs**: 
   Use `lxc-info` to get the console log.
   ```bash
   sudo lxc-info -n my-container -s
   ```
   This can provide insights into any errors.
2. **Network Issues**: 
   Ensure the `lxcbr0` bridge interface is up and configured correctly:
   ```bash
   ip addr show lxcbr0
   ```
3. **Permissions**: 
   Run commands with `sudo` to avoid permissions-related errors.

### Conclusion
LXC is a powerful tool for managing lightweight, isolated environments in Linux, especially with Ubuntu. This cheat sheet covers the essential commands and configurations you need to get started quickly and effectively. Mastering these commands will not only enhance your container management skills but also improve your overall system administration capabilities.
