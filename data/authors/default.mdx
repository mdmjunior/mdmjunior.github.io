## Who Am I? (What's My Name?)

Hi! I am Marcio, a geek from Brazil.

<p align="justify">
IT professional with 25 years of experience, my first challenge was on the beginning of the century (2001) as a Linux Systems
Administrator and have been developed my technical skills over the years, focused on specializing in network infrastructure,
cybersecurity, and unix based operating systems.

I am 43 years old and have been deeply involved with Linux and FreeBSD since 1998, which sparked my passion for
technology. Since 2001, I have worked consistently in the IT industry, gaining extensive experience in implementing, maintaining, and
supporting users of all levels, complex networks and sensitive data systems. My career has been focused on ensuring high reliability
and productivity in IT environments, with a strong emphasis on automation, containerization, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.
Turned proficient in a bunch of technologies including Ansible, Terraform, LXD containers, NAS, Docker, Kubernetes, Shell Scripting,
Python Scripting, Public Cloud providers, among others, and have successfully contributed to teams in Brazilian and international
companies.

I also work in personal projects, like this blog (still in development), where I share my knowledge and experiences with the
community and some scripts that i developed to make my daily basis work easier. I am always looking for new challenges and
opportunities to learn and grow in my career.

Let's connect and share experiences!
