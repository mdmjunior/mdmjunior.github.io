## My Background

<div align="justify">

With 25 years of experience, I started as a Linux Systems Administrator in 2001, specializing in network infrastructure, cybersecurity, and 
Unix-based systems. Passionate about Linux and FreeBSD since 1998, I’ve worked in IT, ensuring high reliability through automation, 
containerization, and cloud computing. Proficient in Ansible, Terraform, LXD, Docker, Kubernetes, scripting, and public clouds, I’ve contributed 
to teams in Brazil and abroad. I also run personal projects, sharing knowledge and automation scripts. Always seeking new challenges 
and learning opportunities.
