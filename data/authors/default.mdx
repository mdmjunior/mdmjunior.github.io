## Who Am I? ( What's My Name?) again...

Experienced DevOps Engineer with over 24 years in IT, I started as a Linux Systems Administrator and worked as one till
the world changed into this automated stuff. I focused on specializing in Network Infrastructure, Cybersecurity, and operating
systems. I am 42 years old and have been deeply involved with Linux and FreeBSD since 1998, which sparked my passion for technology.
Since 2000, I have worked consistently in the IT industry, gaining extensive experience in implementing, maintaining, and supporting 
complex networks and data systems. My career has been focused on ensuring high reliability and productivity in IT environments, with a 
strong emphasis on automation, containerization, cloud computing, and security. My last professional experiences were in Telecom 
companies, which provided me with knowledge about telecommunication networks which allowed me to work in other areas. I am proficient
in several technologies including Ansible (for Linux and MacOS), Terraform, LXD containers, NAS, Docker, Kubernetes, and GCP, among 
others, and have successfully contributed to several teams in Brazilian and international companies.
